## Personalized Healthcare Application

# Project Overview
This is a React Native project designed for healthcare applications. It provides features for managing patient data, tracking health metrics, and facilitating communication between patients and healthcare providers.

## Key Features
- User authentication and profile management
- Device list and metrics analysis
- Suggestions and recommendations based on user input

# Installation Instructions
To set up the development environment, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Node.js
- Watchman
- React Native CLI
- Android Studio or Xcode (for Android/iOS development)

Follow the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions for detailed setup.

# Getting Started
> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server
First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application
Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android
```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS
```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

## Step 3: Modifying your App
Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Folder Structure
- `src/`: Contains the main application code.
- `src/screens/`: Contains different screens of the application.
- `src/components/`: Contains reusable components.
- `ios/` and `android/`: Platform-specific code and configurations.

## Components Overview
- **Button**: A reusable button component for various actions.
- **InputField**: A component for user input.
- **SocialButton**: A component for social media login options.

# Troubleshooting
If you can't get this to work, see the [Troubleshooting](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting) page. Common issues include:
- Metro server not starting
